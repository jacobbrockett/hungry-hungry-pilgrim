## Description
Developed for the UTSA Fall 2024 Game Development game jam "Feast" theme. Similar to Galaga, Hungry Hungry Pilgrim has the player dodging cranberry sauce to catch points (turkey, mashed potatoes, gravy). Be careful not to eat too much turkey! The tryptophan effect will slow the player down significantly.

## Controls
Press 'A' to move left, 'D' to move right.
